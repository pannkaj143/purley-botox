              For individuals living with <span className="font-semibold text-primary">chronic migraines</span> defined as experiencing headaches on 15 or more days per month, we offer more than just cosmetic treatment. This neuromodulating treatment has emerged as a powerful tool in the fight against debilitating headache disorders.

              <li>Works preventatively by blocking pain-associated neurotransmitters when injected into specific areas of the head and neck.</li>
              <li>Reduces the frequency, intensity, and duration of migraine days over time.</li>
              <li>Clinical studies show up to a <span className="font-semibold text-primary">50% reduction</span> in headache days for many individuals with repeated treatments (every 12 weeks).</li>
              <li>Especially effective for high-frequency migraines, with benefits increasing over successive cycles.</li>
              <li>Minimally invasive: sessions last ~20 minutes with a series of small injections; side effects are generally mild and localized.</li>
              <li>Often covered by insurance for those who meet criteria for chronic migraine.</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="text-base text-gray-700 mb-4 max-w-xl">
              In the evolving landscape of migraine management, this stands out as a scientifically backed, patient-approved solutionâ€”offering not just fewer headaches, but a renewed sense of control and quality of life.
